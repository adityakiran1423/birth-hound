# birth-hound
<!-- Line break -->
A UNIX daemon to keep track and notify you about all the birthdays your pea sized brain can't seem to remember, written in Rust ðŸ¦€

## To Note

* I am not a Rustacean by any means (read the LICENSE)
* Currently, birth-hound works as a standalone program (am currently learning and working on daemonizing it)
* Commands like `add`, `delete`, and `edit` will be implemented eventually to edit both dates and names

UPDATE :
 
  still working on it in between
   
NOTE :
 
  instead of writing birth-hound as a daemon it makes more sense to write it as a cron job (also async rust is absolutely diabolical)
  
  why? cron jobs are more resource and energy efficient
